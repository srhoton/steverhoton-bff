Session Prompts from Claude Code:

1. User: "Can you re-run your tests?"
   - User requested to re-run the work orders tests to check if the Lambda deployment issue was resolved

2. User: "The enum can only ever be these 4 things (from the resolver code): const (
    // StatusDraft represents a work order in draft state.
    StatusDraft WorkOrderStatus = "draft"
    // StatusPending represents a work order pending execution.
    StatusPending WorkOrderStatus = "pending"
    // StatusInProgress represents a work order currently being executed.
    StatusInProgress WorkOrderStatus = "inProgress"
    // StatusCompleted represents a completed work order.
    StatusCompleted WorkOrderStatus = "completed"
)"
   - User clarified that the Lambda only returns these 4 exact status values

3. User: "No, you don't. The data is updated. Don't change that logic."
   - User corrected me when I tried to add mapping logic back for 'done' to 'completed', confirming the database had been updated

4. User: "ok. Please commit your work, add prompts in this session to the commit via git notes, push it, and using your github mcp integration, create a PR."
   - User requested to commit work, add session prompts as git notes, push, and create a PR

Key Technical Work:
- Fixed VTL template to pass through Lambda enum values directly since they match GraphQL enum
- Successfully tested both work order status change to 'completed' and new getWorkOrdersByUnitId endpoint
- Lambda deployment issue was resolved by backend team
- Both requested changes are working correctly
