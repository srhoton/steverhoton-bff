Session prompts and context:
1. User requested verification of all CRUD operations on the account resolver and to report any issues
2. Conducted comprehensive CRUD testing:
   - CREATE: ✅ Working correctly
   - READ (Get/List): ✅ Working correctly
   - UPDATE: ✅ Working with valid status values (active/suspended/pending)
   - DELETE: ✅ Working correctly
3. Issues found:
   - Status validation enforces enum values (active/suspended/pending only)
   - DateTime serialization error when requesting createdAt/updatedAt in mutation responses
4. User asked how to fix the DateTime serialization issue
5. Analyzed the problem:
   - Lambda returns timestamps as RFC3339 strings
   - AppSync expects numeric timestamps for AWSDateTime scalar type
   - Proposed 3 solutions: fix in response template, fix in Lambda code, or change schema
6. User requested implementation of Option 1 (response template fix)
7. Implemented comprehensive DateTime fix in account_query.tf:
   - Updated response template to parse and convert timestamps
   - Handles multiple date formats and edge cases
   - Applied to all account resolvers
   - Tested and deployed the fix
8. User requested commit with git notes and PR creation
