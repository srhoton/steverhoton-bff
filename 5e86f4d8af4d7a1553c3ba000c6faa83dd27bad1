User requested: 'Ok. Now, we need to update the work order schema. It should require a unitId on create - you can look in the code in steverhoton-work-order/lambda to verify.'

Session included:
- Re-running work order tests after Lambda deployment fix
- Removing test code from PR #19
- Resolving git checkout blocking issues
- Adding 1000 character description field to labor lines schema
- Making unitId required on work order creation based on Lambda validation

Key changes made:
1. Updated work order status enum handling in VTL template
2. Removed all test files from PR while preserving production code
3. Added description field to labor lines schema and inputs
4. Made unitId required in CreateWorkOrderInput and WorkOrder type
5. Added optional unitId to UpdateWorkOrderInput

Lambda validation analysis showed unitId is required with UUID format validation in work-order-schema.json
