Session Prompts and Context:

Initial Request: "ok, can you try to plan and apply it."
- User requested to plan and apply the terraform changes for events resolver

Main Task: "Ok. Now, using the graphql events resolver you just created, please add 10 random events to unit 26e50d66-5e4c-4808-ac79-99754b8f40f6 (which is in account acc-e4c8f468-e0b1-7049-6f0f-48b0b4f27aa5). There are temporary credentials you can do this in ~/git/tmp/pass.json you can use to authenticate. You have access to the aws cli to troubleshoot any issues. Let me know what questions you have. Ultrathink."

Debugging Guidance: "You can also query the resolver cloudwatch logs if that helps."

Session involved:
1. Applying terraform configuration for events GraphQL resolver
2. Creating 10 diverse random events using GraphQL mutations
3. Troubleshooting lambda interface conversion errors via CloudWatch logs
4. Iterating on event creation scripts to fix validation errors
5. Identifying and reporting lambda bugs for query operations
6. Testing fixes and verifying full functionality

Key technical challenges resolved:
- AppSync resolver template argument passing ($context.arguments vs $context.arguments.input)
- Event validation errors (account ID format, event types, priority values)
- Lambda interface conversion bugs in query operations
- GraphQL response format issues for list operations

Final outcome: Fully functional events GraphQL API with 10 test events successfully created and verified.
