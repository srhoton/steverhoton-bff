PROMPTS USED IN THIS SESSION:

1. Initial Request:
"An upstream team using the bff defined in the terraform directory found the following issue with the implement, and has a proposed fix below. Can you implement it?   ⚠️ Important Location ID Issue

I discovered and documented a significant issue with the current GraphQL schema:

Problem: The current GraphQL schema for AddressLocation and CoordinatesLocation types does not include a locationId field, even though the backend DynamoDB location service stores locations with proper UUID locationIds as the Primary Key.

Current Workaround: Implemented a content-based hash system that generates stable identifiers from location content (address details or coordinates). This allows the dropdown to function with current schema limitations.

Proper Solution Needed:
1. Update GraphQL schema to include locationId: String\! in both location types
2. Update listLocations query to return actual database locationIds
3. Remove temporary hash-based ID system once schema is updated"

2. Follow-up Request:
"can you plan and apply those changes is you didn't already?"

3. Final Request:
"OK. please add the prompts used in this section to the commit via the 'git notes' functionality."

IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY:
- Added locationId: String\! field to both AddressLocation and CoordinatesLocation GraphQL types
- Updated test payloads for get_location.json and list_locations.json to include locationId field
- Verified existing AppSync resolvers were properly configured
- Created comprehensive todo list and tracked progress through completion
- All changes ready for backend to populate actual database UUIDs instead of content hashes
