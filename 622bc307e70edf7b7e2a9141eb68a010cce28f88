Session Prompts and Context:

Bug Report Investigation 1: "Hi, we have a bug report on the events endpoint. Can you look at it? If the problem is the downstream lambda, write up the issue so I can have another team look at it. The reported issue is: Error Analysis - Error Type: DynamoDB ValidationException..."

Testing After Fix 1: "This is reported as fixed now. Can you retest?"

Bug Report Investigation 2: "Hi, we have another bug report on the events endpoint. Can you look at it? If the problem is the downstream lambda, write up the issue so I can have another team look at it. The reported issue is: Error Analysis - Error Type: GraphQL validation error in the BFF backend..."

Testing After Fix 2: "This is reported as fixed now. Can you retest?"

Final Documentation Request: "ok. Please commit your work, add prompts in this session to the commit via git notes, push it, and using your github mcp integration, create a PR."

Session involved:
1. Investigating DynamoDB ValidationException for reserved keyword "status" in listEventsByStatus
2. Testing and verifying fix for DynamoDB reserved keyword escaping
3. Investigating updateEvent validation being too strict for status-only updates on maintenance events
4. Testing and verifying fix for partial update validation
5. Comprehensive verification of all GraphQL operations after fixes
6. Documenting bug reports and test verification results

Key technical findings:
- DynamoDB reserved keyword "status" needed Expression Attribute Names escaping
- Lambda conditional validation was too strict for maintenance events requiring maintenanceDetails
- All query operations (getEvent, listEventsByUnit, listEventsByCategory, listEventsByStatus) working
- All mutation operations (createEvent, updateEvent) working after fixes
- Status updates now work for both maintenance and fault events
- Comprehensive test coverage across 10 test events

Final outcome: All events GraphQL API operations fully functional with documented bug resolution.
