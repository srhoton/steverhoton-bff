Session prompts:

User Request 1: 'Ok. The locations lambda has changed, and now also supports a 'shop' location type. Look at the aws cli, and the source code in ../steverhoton-location/lambda and update the location graphql schema, run terraform apply to push out your changes, and verify it works. Ultrathink.'

User Request 2: 'Re-evaluate the lambda and the issue that was identified. It should be fixed. Update your work accordingly.'

User Request 3: 'ok. Please commit your work, add prompts in this session to the commit via git notes, push it, and using your github mcp integration, create a PR.'

User Request 4: 'ok. Now, using the part endpoint in this graphql schema, we need to create some seed data for parts. Create 10 random parts. You can use random data for the data, *except* for the fact that all these parts should be in account e4c8f468-e0b1-7049-6f0f-48b0b4f27aa5, and must be in one of 3 locations: a1464262-f231-4266-9d25-d05d40f18f77, b022c3a7-02a5-49f7-ab48-00498b5c5e9a, or ef242e42-57d1-4d63-86aa-48d789d42960. There are temporary credentials in ~/git/tmp/pass.json you can use to auth against the endpoint, and you can use the aws cli for troubleshooting. Ultrathink this, and let me know what questions you have.'

User Request 5: 'The lambda resolver code is in ../steverhoton-part/lambda. You can look through that source code to figure out the structure it expects. Continue.'

User Request 6: 'Ok, I see that issue, and it's now been fixed in the lambda - the record be either location#{location-uuid}#{part-uuid} or unit#{unit-uuid}#{part-uuid}. This should allow multiple parts with the same attributes to exist at the same location. Can you review the new code, update the bff schema, then add the test data?'

User Request 7: 'ok. Please commit your work, add prompts in this session to the commit via git notes, push it, and using your github mcp integration, create a PR.'
