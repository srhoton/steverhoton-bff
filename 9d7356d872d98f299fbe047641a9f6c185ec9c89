Session prompts:

User Request 1: 'Ok. The locations lambda has changed, and now also supports a 'shop' location type. Look at the aws cli, and the source code in ../steverhoton-location/lambda and update the location graphql schema, run terraform apply to push out your changes, and verify it works. Ultrathink.'

User Request 2: 'Re-evaluate the lambda and the issue that was identified. It should be fixed. Update your work accordingly.'

User Request 3: 'ok. Please commit your work, add prompts in this session to the commit via git notes, push it, and using your github mcp integration, create a PR.'

User Request 4: 'ok. Now, using the part endpoint in this graphql schema, we need to create some seed data for parts. Create 10 random parts. You can use random data for the data, *except* for the fact that all these parts should be in account e4c8f468-e0b1-7049-6f0f-48b0b4f27aa5, and must be in one of 3 locations: a1464262-f231-4266-9d25-d05d40f18f77, b022c3a7-02a5-49f7-ab48-00498b5c5e9a, or ef242e42-57d1-4d63-86aa-48d789d42960. There are temporary credentials in ~/git/tmp/pass.json you can use to auth against the endpoint, and you can use the aws cli for troubleshooting. Ultrathink this, and let me know what questions you have.'

User Request 5: 'The lambda resolver code is in ../steverhoton-part/lambda. You can look through that source code to figure out the structure it expects. Continue.'

User Request 6: 'Ok, I see that issue, and it's now been fixed in the lambda - the record be either location#{location-uuid}#{part-uuid} or unit#{unit-uuid}#{part-uuid}. This should allow multiple parts with the same attributes to exist at the same location. Can you review the new code, update the bff schema, then add the test data?'

User Request 7: 'ok. Please commit your work, add prompts in this session to the commit via git notes, push it, and using your github mcp integration, create a PR.'

Tasks completed:
- Previously implemented shop location support in GraphQL schema
- Reviewed updated parts lambda code with new sortKey structure
- Updated BFF GraphQL schema to include partId field
- Created 10 realistic automotive parts as seed data distributed across 3 locations
- Verified parts creation through direct lambda calls and GraphQL API integration
- Deployed schema changes and confirmed functionality

Additional session work completed:

User Request 8: 'Using the temporary credentials in ~/git/tmp/pass.json, could you try deleting the part with accountId e4c8f468-e0b1-7049-6f0f-48b0b4f27aa5 and sort key location#a1464262-f231-4266-9d25-d05d40f18f77#dd2dfdbf-e5c7-4c49-b673-6414ede81ec1 using the bff, and if you see any errors, troubleshoot them?'

User Request 9: 'This issue should now be resolved in the lambda. Can you retry?'

User Request 10: 'ok. Please commit your work, add prompts in this session to the commit via git notes, push it, and using your github mcp integration, create a PR.'

Troubleshooting and Testing completed:
- Discovered and diagnosed parts lambda validation bug in sortKey parsing
- Lambda was expecting 2-part sortKey (location#{uuid}) but receiving 3-part format (location#{locationId}#{partId})
- Verified lambda validation fix was applied to handle 3-part sortKey format correctly
- Successfully tested part deletion via direct lambda calls
- Successfully tested part deletion via BFF GraphQL API
- Confirmed proper response format: DeletePartResponse with success/message fields
- Verified actual data deletion from database
- Tested with 2 different parts, both deleted successfully
- Full BFF integration validated as working correctly

Test Results:
✅ Direct Lambda deletion: Working correctly
✅ BFF GraphQL deletion: Working correctly
✅ Response format: Proper DeletePartResponse structure
✅ Data integrity: Parts actually removed from database
✅ Authentication: Cognito integration working
✅ Error handling: Proper NOT_FOUND responses for missing parts
