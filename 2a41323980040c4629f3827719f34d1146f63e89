Session Prompts:

1. User: "There is a need for a new resolver for actions. The lambda for this is deployed in AWS, and the source code is in .../steverhoton-action/lambda. Update the graphql implementation to add an endpoint for parts. You can read (but not modify) the source code, and use AWS credentials and temporary credentials in ~/git/tmp/pass.json to test how the lambda works. Update the appsync implementation in the terraform directory to support this endpoint. Ultrathink this, and ask me any questions you have."

2. User: "ok. Please commit your work, add prompts in this session to the commit via git notes, push it, and using your github mcp integration, create a PR."

Context:
- This was a continuation from a previous session where parts resolver was implemented
- User requested actions resolver integration (note: prompt mentioned "parts" but context shows "actions")
- Task involved reading existing lambda source code in steverhoton-action/lambda
- Integration with AppSync GraphQL API through terraform configuration
- Testing with AWS credentials provided in ~/git/tmp/pass.json
- Full deployment and verification of the actions GraphQL endpoint

Implementation Summary:
- Explored actions lambda structure and API (6 operations)
- Designed comprehensive GraphQL schema for commercial vehicle maintenance
- Created terraform configuration for AppSync integration
- Successfully deployed and tested the actions resolver
- Verified lambda responds correctly to GraphQL events
