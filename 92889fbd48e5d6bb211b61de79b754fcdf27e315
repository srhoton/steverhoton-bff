Session prompts that led to this implementation:

1. "There is a need for a new resolver for labor-lines. The lambda for this is deployed in AWS, and the source code is in .../steverhoton-labor-lines/lambda. Update the graphql implementation to add an endpoint for labor-lines. You can read (but not modify) the source code, and use AWS credentials and temporary credentials in ~/git/tmp/pass.json to test how the lambda works. Update the appsync implementation in the terraform directory to support this endpoint. Ultrathink this, and ask me any questions you have."

2. "ok, this is now reported as fixed. Can you confirm? If it is fixed, delete the bug report."

3. "There is a need for a new resolver for tasks. The lambda for this is deployed in AWS, and the source code is in .../steverhoton-task/lambda. Update the graphql implementation to add an endpoint for tasks. You can read (but not modify) the source code, and use AWS credentials and temporary credentials in ~/git/tmp/pass.json to test how the lambda works. Update the appsync implementation in the terraform directory to support this endpoint. Ultrathink this, and ask me any questions you have."

4. "Could you describe the minor issue so I could get the lambda team working on it?"

5. "ok, that is reported as fixed. Can you confirm?"

6. "Can you explain the null data issue so I can get the lambda team to work on it?"

7. "ok. Could you retry?"

8. "Please check that issue again."

9. "Please check that issue again."

10. "Switch the graphql implementation to 'in-progress' please."

11. "Please check that issue again."

Key technical challenges resolved:
- Lambda argument parsing issues (event.Info.FieldName vs event.FieldName)
- GraphQL enum value incompatibility (inProgress vs in-progress)
- VTL template mapping for status transformation
- Validation requirements (laborlinesId cannot be empty)
- Response format mapping between lambda and GraphQL
