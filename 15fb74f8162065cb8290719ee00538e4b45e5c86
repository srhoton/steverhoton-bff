User Request: Add 1000 character description field to labor lines schema

User: "Ok. The labor lines resolver now support a 1000 character description field (the code is in ../steverhoton-labor-lines/lambda if you need to look at it. Can you modify the labor lines schema to support that?"

Technical Implementation:
- Examined labor lines Lambda code to understand field structure
- Description field is optional (omitempty) with 1000 character max validation
- Updated LaborLine type to include description: String field
- Updated CreateLaborLineInput and UpdateLaborLineInput to include description
- Deployed schema changes successfully
- Verified existing labor lines already have rich descriptions populated
- Field is working correctly with validation enforced by Lambda layer

Key Finding: The Lambda already returns comprehensive descriptions like:
- "Comprehensive serpentine belt inspection and preparation work including initial setup"
- "Complete serpentine belt inspection, installation, and equipment setup procedures"
- Field is fully functional and ready for use
