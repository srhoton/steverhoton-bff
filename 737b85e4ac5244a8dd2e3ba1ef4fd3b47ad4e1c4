User requests from this session:
1. 'Ok, we need to make a change to the labor lines resolver on create. The labor lines can be optional on create - you can verify this in ../steverhoton-labor-lines/lambda. Can you update the graphql schema?'
   - Analysis: Labor lines schema was already correctly configured with optional fields
   - No changes needed as description, partId, and notes were already optional

2. 'Ok, we need to make a change to the tasks resolver on create. The labor lines can be optional on create - you can verify this in ../steverhoton-tasks/lambda. Can you update the graphql schema?'
   - Analyzed task Lambda code and found laborlinesId and description are optional
   - Updated CreateTaskInput: description String\! -> String, laborlinesId [String\!]\! -> [String\!]
   - Updated Task type: description String\! -> String, laborlinesId [String\!]\! -> [String\!]
   - Tested successfully: task creation works with only required fields

3. 'ok. Please commit your work, add prompts in this session to the commit via git notes, push it, and using your github mcp integration, create a PR.'
   - Committing changes with detailed description
   - Adding git notes documenting the session
   - Pushing to remote branch
   - Creating PR with GitHub integration

Technical analysis performed:
- Examined steverhoton-task Lambda validator: laborlinesId validation only if len > 0
- Examined task models: NewTask initializes empty arrays for nil fields
- Examined CreateTaskInput struct: omitempty tags indicate optional fields
- Verified Lambda behavior matches GraphQL schema updates
- Tested task creation with minimal required fields successfully

Changes made:
1. tasks_query.graphql: Made laborlinesId and description optional in CreateTaskInput and Task type
2. work_orders_query.graphql: Previously made unitId required in CreateWorkOrderInput (from earlier session)

Both changes align GraphQL schema with Lambda implementation requirements.
